## Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction — Power BI + Python Project

## 💡 Project Summary
This project analyzes telecom customer churn using **Power BI** for business insights and **Python Machine Learning** to predict churn probability at a customer level.

The goal is to help businesses:
- Identify **why customers churn**
- Detect **high-risk customers early**
- Support **targeted retention strategies**

---

## 📂 Dataset
**Source:** Kaggle — Telco Customer Churn  
Contains 7,043 customer records with demographics, billing, services, and contract data.

## 🚀 Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning
- Converted `TotalCharges` to numeric
- Handled missing values
- Created churn flag

### 2️⃣ Churn Analysis (Power BI)
- Churn Rate %
- Churn by Contract, Internet Service, Payment Method
- Avg Tenure & Charges comparison

### 3️⃣ Churn Prediction (Python)
- Logistic Regression Model
- Features:
  - tenure, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges
  - Contract, InternetService, PaymentMethod
- Output:
  - `ChurnProbability`
  - `ChurnPredicted`
- Exported → `Telco_Churn_Predictions.csv`

### 4️⃣ Power BI Prediction Dashboard
- Integrated prediction file
- Built **risk segmentation dashboard**
  - High Risk (≥ 0.70)
  - Medium Risk (0.40–0.69)
  - Low Risk (< 0.40)
